<h1>Walkthrough</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Create a folder to house the Python script</li>
  <li>Copy (or move) the Seleinum driver into the same folder. You can download the one in this repo or the one at http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads should there be a more recent version</li>
  <li>Run the following command in your command-line terminal to install the required Python libraries: pip install selenium</li>
  <li>Run the script by running this command or by double-clicking: python test.py on the file itself</li>
</ul>

Note: Bare in mind that as my friend already has a script running on his server, I commented out the command that actually submits the request (this is seen in line #45)
