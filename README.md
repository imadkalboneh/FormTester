<h1>Walkthrough</h1>
<ol>
  <li>You will have to create a folder to house this Python file</li>
  <li>Copy (or move) the Seleinum driver into the same folder. You can download the driver at http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads </li>
  <li>Run this command in your command-line terminal: pip install selenium</li>
  <li>Run the script by running this command: python test.py</li>
</ul>

Note: Bare in mind that as my friend already has a script running on his server, I commented out the command that actually submits the request (this is seen in line #45)
